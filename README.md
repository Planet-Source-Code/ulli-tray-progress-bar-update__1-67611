### Description

A progress bar is a very temporary thing but still requires permanent space in a form. Wouldn't it be better to use a temporary space for it also? This project temporarily uses the system tray to display a customizable progress bar. Just include form fProgress and clsSystray with your project and set it's properties. A lil testform is included to show how it could be used. I know there are hundreds of progress bars in PSC, but this one is a little different - try it, download is 8 kB.
